# Kanban-Task-Board

## Description
A simple, color-coded task board for managing to-do tasks within a team. This project had some starter code, which included all the HTML other than the Modal for creating new tasks, some CSS, and the names and descriptions of functions without any code. The HTML uses Bootstrap classes, which is why there is so little CSS. One of the acceptance requirements was that the code should be jQuery, which I found much easier to work with than vanilla JavaScript. Having each of the functions already aptly named along with a clear description was very helpful as I was getting started. I spent most of my time during this project on re-writing my functions as I searched and found different ways to apply the jQuery methods. 

## Usage 
The application is intended to be run in a browser.
